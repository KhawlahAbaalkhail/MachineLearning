Exploratory Data Analysis – Chocolate Sales Dataset

This assignment focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand a real-world sales dataset. The process involved inspecting the data structure, identifying and handling missing or inconsistent values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Through univariate, bivariate, and time-based analysis, patterns in revenue, sales distribution, and relationships between variables were identified. This process improved understanding of how raw data is cleaned, explored, and interpreted before any advanced analysis.

Overall, the assignment strengthened practical skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from structured data.
