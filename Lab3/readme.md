Dataset & Analysis Summary

This dataset contains news articles, where each row represents a single article and includes features such as the article text and a label indicating whether the news is fake or real. The data mainly consists of textual information along with a categorical target variable.

During the analysis, the dataset was inspected and cleaned to ensure data quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to understand the distribution of fake and real news, examine article length, and identify differences in writing patterns between the two classes.

Overall, this process helped in understanding the structure of the dataset and extracting meaningful insights from the text data before moving to any advanced modeling tasks.
